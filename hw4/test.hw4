#!./hw4 
echo * Echo seems to work

echo * Now the directory contents:
ls

echo * Now the number of files:
ls | wc -l

echo * Now we should see "Hello World":
echo Hello World > /tmp/hwfile
cat <  /tmp/hwfile
cat < /tmp/hwfile > /tmp/hwfile2
cat /tmp/hwfile  /tmp/hwfile2 > /tmp/doublefile 

echo * Now we should see a number "2", for the number of lines, in /tmp/countfile
cat < /tmp/doublefile | wc -l  > /tmp/countfile

echo * And now the contents of /tmp/countfile
cat /tmp/countfile

echo * Now a list of file sizes 
ls -l | sort -n -k 5 | cut -c 27-34

echo * And finally "hello world hello world"
./hw4 echo.hw4 hello world
